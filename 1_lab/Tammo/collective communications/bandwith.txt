=====
The time of awareness is the time until all processes are aware of the message.

time of awareness = (p-1)*(n/b+a)

where p = number of processes, n = length of message in bytes, b = bandwidth in bytes per second, a = processing latency

=====
> broadcast
The sender can be broadcast the message to all recipients.
But MPI_send is blocking, so the time of awereness is still the same!
time of awareness = (p-1)*(n/b+a)

> anycast
If there very much recipients, the sender can send it only
to the (topologically) nearest nodes. This node will do the same.
It's like an unicast because any node can send only one time at once!
The time of awarness is decreased by log2.
time of awareness = log2(p)*(n/b+a)
